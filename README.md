# plg_loadcoord
This Google Map extension built for Joomla will allow you to add a quick clickable map icon into a Joomla article using coordinates within content.

###Usage:###
Basic options (parameters), default settings are:

* Map mode -> Use a parent/new window to open the map view
* Map zoom -> Map view level

Need a map locator tool to find both addresses and geographic coordinates, try our [Geocoder tool](http://www.noxidsoft.com/otherApps/getAddress/getAddress.html).
